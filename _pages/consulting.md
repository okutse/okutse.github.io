## Statistical Consulting

I am available for private statistical consulting. Throughout my PhD, I've had the good fortune to work as a statistical analyst for The Department of Medicine at Western University.  In that role I provided statistical services to researching physicians, including: but not limited to:

* Providing statistical expertise in grant writing
* Helping design analysis plans for funded studies
* Helping clean data to prepare for modelling
* Statistical modelling
* Reporting and interpreting results of modelling
* Communication of results to non-expert audiences (including writing manuscripts for publication), and
* Responding to reviewer requests.

If you need help with statistics of any kind, I'm always open to lend a hand.  Please feel free to reach out at dpananos [at] gmail [dot] com.

## Pricing

I have variable pricing depending on requirements and timeline to complete work.  For classic statistical modelling of data, hourly rates start at \\$75 per hour.  For clinical prediction modelling, rates start at \\$150 per hour.  Additional fees are applied if work is to be prioritized (for example, for an upcoming deadline).  I offer a 30 minute consult free of charge to scope out project needs and will send you an estimated cost for the work.
