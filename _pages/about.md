I am a Biostatistics Graduate Research Fellow and a Master of Science (MSc.) Candidate at Brown Universityâ€™s School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. My research interests revolve around using data to inform public health decisions through statistical machine learning, missing data and causal inference, survival analysis, and statistical modeling. <br>

In 2019, I led a team that emerged as the third runner-up in a hackathon where we designed an ensemble of machine learning algorithms for patient classification in a diagnostic healthcare context. In September 2021, I was awarded the Moi-Brown Partnership in Biostatistics Training and HIV Research (NAMBARI) Fellowship, a collaborative program between Moi and Brown University geared towards capacity building in Biostatistics. I earned my undergraduate degree in Biostatistics from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). <br>
