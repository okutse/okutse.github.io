## Abstract

The impact of different sleeping categories on the risk of breast cancer has remained
debatable. This paper sought to systematically synthesise the available literature on
this relationship from population-based cohort studies using meta-analytic
procedures. Studies about sleep duration and breast cancer were identified from the Cochrane
Library database, EMBASE and PubMed databases for papers published up to February
2019.

Identified studies were analysed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Effect
sizes were visualised using funnel plots. Study heterogeneity was quantified using I2
and visualised using Baujat plots. Publication prejudice was evaluated using Eggers
regression model, with visualisations using funnel plots.
Eight cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. 
Random-effects model revealed nonstatistically significant evidence of an association between short or long sleep and breast cancer Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.90;(95% CI 0.79–1.02) and OR=0.95 (0.88–1.02)respectively. There was moderate to high heterogeneity I2 (95% CI)=74.40% (48.20–
87.40%) among studies examining short sleep and breast cancer, and low to moderate
heterogeneity in studies for long sleep and breast cancer I2 (95% CI)=3.0% (0.00–
68.60%).

This study found non-substantial evidence of associations between sleeping periods
and breast cancer in women. Studies employing novel sleep-measurement
methodologies should be carried out to examine the underlying relationship.
