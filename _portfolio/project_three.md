## Project summary:

This is a collaborative project with Dr. Ernest Julian (Co-chair with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and the Food and Drugs Administration [FDA] of the Healthy People 2030 Foodborne Illness Reduction Committee). In the project, we use statistical machine methods for multiclass classification including Random forests, Na√Øve Bayes Classification, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to predict the food source of a 
*Listeria monocytogene* strain and isolate to propose a robust and throughput predictive framework for 
driving action in the fight against foodborne illnesses using data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Pathogen Detection Database.
