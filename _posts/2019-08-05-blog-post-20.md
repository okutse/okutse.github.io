Another short update:  I've made a PR to merge `pymc3.ode` into PyMC3!

I've gotten some good feedback on the API and am currently working on a shape fix so that users won't need to `reshape` the result from `DifferentialEquation`.  This is actually giving me a lot of anxiety because I think it requires some insight into Theano which I just don't have.  Will keep you updated with what happens when I write the final blog post in 2 weeks time!

Here is the [PR](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3578)!
