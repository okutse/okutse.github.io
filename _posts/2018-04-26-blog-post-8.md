I was recently asked to make 4 plots for a collaborator. The plots are all the same, just a scatter plot and a non-linear trend line.  Every time I have to do something repetitive, I wince, *especially with respect to plots*.  I thought I would take this opportunity to write a short blog post on how to use functional programming in R to make the same plot for similar yet different data.  

Side note: The result could probably be obtained through clever use of ggplot2's `geom_smooth`, but I don't think that workflow would generalize well.

# Step 1: Understand the Problem

The data contain some clinical variables and the concentration of a drug in the body.  My collaborator just wants a scatter plot and a trend line.  Linear regression isn't appropriate because concentration must be positive and preliminary looks at the data show a non-linear trend.  We both agreed a log transform is appropriate for the concentration data.  So the plan is to:

* Log the concentration data
* Perorm a linear regression on the log scale
* Transform the data and the predictions back to the original scale
* Plot the resulting exponential trend as well as the original data.

I have to do that for 4 variables.  


# Step 2: Put 4 Data Sets Into 1 Dataframe

I've loaded the data into a variable called `c.data`.  There are 5 columns all in all (concentration and 4 covariates).  What I want is 4 seperate data sets, each with 2 columns (1 for concentration, 1 for the covariate).  If I use `gather`, `group_by` the covariate names, and then `nest` I can get what I want.  I would suggest you make your own data set as I have described and follow along so you can see what is happening.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

# Make 4 datasets and store in one dataset
step.2 = c.data %>% 
		 gather(var, value, -Concentration) %>% 
		 group_by(var) %>%
		 nest(.key = 'obs.data')


```


Now I have 4 datasets which are essentially the same and they all live in `step.2`.

# Step 3: Map The Data To a Linear Regression

I can use `map` to store models fitted to each covariate.  Each of the smaller covariate has a column called `Concentration` and another called `value`.  If we had one of these smaller datasets infront of us, we would do `lm(log(Concentration) ~ . , data = smaller.data)` to fit the linear model.  Since we have a column of datasets, I do

``` r

step.3 = step.2  %>% 
		mutate(
			model = map(obs.data, ~lm(log(Concentration) ~ ., data = .x) #Fit models here
			)

```


# Step 4: Set Up New Data To Predict On

In order to plot a trend line, I need a grid of new data.  The library `modelr` has some great utilities for this sort of thing.  The `data_grid` function does just what I want.

``` r
library(modelr)

step.4 = step3 %>%
		 mutate(
		 	newdata = map(obs.data, ~ data_grid(.x, value = seq_range(value,20)) ) 
		 	)
```

Now I have another new column called `newdata` which has a dataframe of evenly spaced observations for each covariate.  All that is left to do is to predict on this data using the model we fit in step 3.

# Step 5: Predict & Transform

Remember, I took the log of concentration, so I will have to exponentiate my predictions.  I have to pass both my model and the new data into the `predict` fucntion, so that means I have to use `map2`.

``` r
step.5 = step.4 %>%
		 mutate(
		 	preds = map2(model, newdata, ~ exp(predict(.x, newdata = .y)) #Dont forget the exp!
		 	)
```


I'll be using ggplot2 to make the plots, so it is best if I have the x's and the y's for the trend line in the same data frame.

``` r

step.5 = step.5 %>%
		 mutate(
		 	pred.data = map2(newdata,preds, ~ .x %>% bind_cols(pred = .y))
		 	)

```

Now I have another column, `pred.data` which has the data I'll need for drawing the trend line.


# Step 6:  Make a Function For the Plots

I've written a nice helper function to help me draw the plots I want.  It will take in as arguments 2 data sets, plotting a scatter plot for 1 data set, and a line plot for the other.  Here is the function:

``` r

make.plot<-function(pred.data, obs.data, vars){
  
  plot = ggplot()+
    geom_point(data = obs.data, aes(value, Concentration), shape = 21, fill = 'gray')+
         geom_line(data = pred.data, aes(value,pred), color = 'red' )+
         labs(x = vars)+
         theme_classic()
  
  return(plot)
  
}

```

# Step 7:  Reduce!

I can use `pmap` to pass in a named list to my `make.plot` function and then use `patchwork` and `reduce` to combine all the plots into a single figure!

``` r

library(patchwork)


arguments = list(pred.data = plotting.data$pred.data, 
                 obs.data = plotting.data$obs.data,
                 vars = c('Var1','Var2','Var3','Var4'))

plots<-pmap(arguments, make.plot)


final = reduce(plots,`+`)

ggsave('purrrplot.png', plot= final, dpi = 800)


```

Here is the final product! Another `for` loop cleverly averted.
