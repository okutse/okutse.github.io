Toronto started a pilot project to shut down King street to private vehicles in and attempt to ease congestion and increase TTC ridership.  I've obtained some data from the city and have begun analyzing it.  Shown [here](http://dpananos.github.io/files/TorontoKSP.html) is an initial plotting of the change in travel times in certain sections of the city. Cooler colors mean travel times have decreased.

I plan on modelling this data very soon.  I'll write a blog post about it once completed.
