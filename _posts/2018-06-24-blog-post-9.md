I'm very proud to say I have contributed [this](http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/GLM-hierarchical-binominal-model.html) example to PyMC3's documentation.  It details how to compute posterior means for Gelman's rat tumour example in BDA3.

Hoping to contribute more material to the library in the future.q
